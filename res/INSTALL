For more informations you might want to see our wiki : http://wiki.freenetproject.org
There is an IRC support channel available in case you have questions : #freenet@irc.freenode.net and a mailing list dedicated to support : support@freenetproject.org



INSTALL:

No actual 'install' process is needed: you need a working Java, best would be the latest version of the 1.5 branch (For now freenet has a 1.4 strict compatibility policy but for performances reasons you might want a newer version).

Basically, all you need to do is make a directoy for freenet, unpack the tarball into that directory, change the permissions so that you can read write and execute as user (non-root) in thet directory and run the start script using the following commands :

"
./bin/1run.sh
./run.sh start 
"

Then, fire up your favorite web browser and point it to http://127.0.0.1:8888 : if you get to a freenet page, your freenet node is up and running.

AT THIS STAGE THE INSTALL IS DONE	

Now you need to name your node, and get it connected to the freenet nework.

- To name your node:
	From your fproxy home page (that's http://127.0.0.1:8888) click on 'configuration', on the left hand side. Find the line  'Node name for darknet' (in the NODE section) and change the default name 'node created around<long string>' to a name of your choice (doesn't need to be unique if possible it ought to contain your email or your IRC nick)

- To get your new freenet node connected to other nodes : 
	Click on the 'darknet' link (that will take you to http://127.0.0.1:8888/darknet) ; at the bottom of the page, you'll see a section called 'My Reference': copy all the text from and including 'LastGoodVersion', to and including 'End'
Using another browser window (or tab) go to http://dark-code.bulix.org or to http://pastebin.ca or to any paste-bin of your choice, paste the reference you copied from your darknet page, hit 'submit', OK, or whatever that's called, and save the url you get: that should look like the address to the pastebin, plus a number or an alphanumeric string after a slash. copy that url.
Using an IRC client, connect to irc.freenode.net and join the channel #freenet-refs ; Post your url, go to other people's urls, copy their references and add them in the big field in your darknet page.

You need to get people to add you: simply adding their refs won't work: you add their refs, they add yours, then your nodes will connect.
