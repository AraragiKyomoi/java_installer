INSTALL:

No actual 'install' process is needed: you need a working Java, best would be the latest version of the 1.6 branch (For now freenet has a 1.4 strict compatibility policy but for performances reasons you might want a newer version).

Basically, all you need to do is make a directoy for freenet, unpack the tarball into that directory, change the permissions so that you can read write and execute as user (non-root) and run the start script using the following command :

"
./run.sh start 
"

Then, fire up your favorite web browser and point it to http://127.0.0.1:8888/wizard/ : if you get to a freenet page, your freenet node is up and running.

AT THIS STAGE THE INSTALL PROCESS IS *DONE*
